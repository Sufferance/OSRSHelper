# Gradle migration

Initiated on May 9 2015

## Importing

In order to create an initial import of the project, follow the following steps:

1.  Open `android-studio`
2.  Close whichever project you might have opened
3.  In the quickstart dialog, pick `Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)`
4.  Use the file browse to select your local checkout of this repository
5.  You will get a pop up showing `Unregistered CVS root detected`, press `Add root`

You should be good to go! If any issue arise, feel free to open a ticket with as much
detail as possible, such as checkout commit id, branch, IDE/gradle version(s), and
any other relevant detail.
